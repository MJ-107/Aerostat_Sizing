% Slenderness ratio refers to the length/max diameter of the sheroid shape.
% Slenderness ratio is represented by lambda and determines aerodynamic 
% performance of the aerostat. A slenderness ratio of 1 refers to a perfect
% sphere.

% Axis def 
% a = length along z
% b = length along x
% c = length along y 

% Guess length and Dmax
length = ;
b = length /2;
a = 
c = D_max;
%d_factor = linspace(); % se as a bunch of fracs
d_factor = 1;
D_max = 1ength * d_factor % set D_max initial to length (sphere case first)
